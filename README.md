#TBeam v1.1 LoRa GPS DeepSleep Example
Maybe this example is useful to someone trying to use the t-beam esp32 device with the espressif32-arduino framework.
It shows how you might use the device as a sort of GPS tracker.

Really it is more intended as an example of how to use various features of the board, than some sort of finished application.

If anyone has any pointers about how to reduce sleep power consumption, I would be interested!

Current sleep power consumption is 60 ÂµA.
